## **1. Purpose**

This document defines a unified standard for **commenting** and **documenting** code used in real-time, sensor-driven, web-based systems that leverage:

* **Python** (for backend logic and Modbus communications)
* **JavaScript + Socket.IO** (for real-time interactivity)
* **HTML/CSS** (for frontend rendering and user experience)

Its purpose is to ensure:

* Code is **clear and maintainable**
* Knowledge is **shared and transferable**
* Technical assets are **aligned with business goals**

---

## **2. Why It Matters**

Well-documented and clearly commented code:

* Speeds up developer onboarding
* Reduces maintenance cost and time
* Prevents misinterpretation of critical logic
* Ensures product reliability during scale or handoff
* Enables transparency for internal and external review

---

## **3. Organizational and Business Impact**

Lack of documentation creates **knowledge silos**, where only a few engineers can understand or maintain parts of the codebase. This presents several critical business risks:

* **Operational delays** when those individuals are unavailable
* **Increased onboarding cost** for new team members
* **Reduced team efficiency** and slower iteration cycles
* **Negative signals during funding or acquisition due diligence**
* **Potential loss of intellectual property clarity**

### **During Funding and Due Diligence**

Investors and acquirers often request access to the codebase for technical review. If the code is not properly documented:

* It may be flagged as **a risk to long-term scalability**
* It could **reduce company valuation**
* It raises concerns around **team maturity and readiness**

### **Protecting the Company and Shareholders**

A well-commented and documented codebase:

* Protects teams from over-reliance on individual contributors
* Reduces business continuity risk
* Safeguards shareholder value
* Reflects engineering and operational maturity

## **4. General Commenting Guidelines**

| Principle                          | Description                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clarity over Cleverness**        | Write code and comments that are easy to understand                           |
| **Explain “Why”, Not Just “What”** | The code shows what is being done; comments should explain why                |
| **Keep Comments Updated**          | Outdated comments are misleading and should be removed or revised             |
| **Avoid Redundancy**               | Don’t restate the obvious; add value through insights                         |
| **Use Docstrings**                 | All public classes, methods, and functions must include structured docstrings |

---

## **5. Language-Specific Standards**

### **Python**

#### Single-line comment

```python
# Connect to Modbus device over TCP
client = ModbusTcpClient('192.168.1.100', port=502)
```

#### Function docstring

```python
def read_temperature():
    """
    Reads temperature data from a Modbus device.

    Returns:
        float: Temperature in Celsius.
    Raises:
        ConnectionError: If the Modbus read fails.
    """
```

#### Block comment

```python
# Read and scale the raw value from register 40001
# Original unit: tenths of degrees Celsius
```

---

### **JavaScript**

#### Single-line comment

```javascript
// Connect to the Socket.IO server
const socket = io();
```

#### Inline comment

```javascript
// Update the temperature display in the UI
socket.on('temperature_update', (data) => {
    document.getElementById('temp-display').textContent = `${data.temp} °C`;
});
```

---

### **HTML**

#### Structural comment

```html
<!-- Section to display real-time temperature readings -->
<div id="dashboard">
    <h2>Live Temperature</h2>
    <p id="temp-display">Waiting for data...</p>
</div>
```

---

### **Modbus**

* Always specify which register you're reading or writing
* Include units and scaling
* Use clear variable naming

```python
# Register 40001: Temperature sensor
# Value in tenths of degrees Celsius
temperature = client.read_holding_registers(0, 1).registers[0] / 10.0
```

---

### **Socket.IO**

* Comment emitted and received events
* Indicate any data contract expected

```javascript
// Emit a request to refresh sensor data from backend
socket.emit('request_sensor_data');

// Listen for the update and handle it
socket.on('temperature_update', (data) => {
    updateTemperatureDisplay(data.temp);
});
```

---

## **6. Documentation Standards**

### **README.md Must Include:**

* **Project Overview**
* **Architecture Summary**
* **Business Value**
* **Technology Stack**
* **Installation and Setup Instructions**
* **Developer Usage Notes**
* **Contact Information or Ownership**

### **Recommended README Structure**

# Smart Monitoring System

## Overview
A real-time industrial monitoring system that connects to Modbus-enabled devices and displays live data in a web interface using Socket.IO.

## Architecture Summary
- Python backend for Modbus and Socket.IO
- JavaScript frontend for real-time UI updates
- HTML/CSS for layout and presentation

## Business Value
- Improves operational awareness
- Reduces downtime via live data insight
- Enables remote monitoring of facility metrics

- pymodbus
- Flask + Flask-SocketIO
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
````

### **Python + Socket.IO**


```python
@socketio.on('request_sensor_data')
def handle_request():
    """
    Handles frontend request for temperature data.
    Emits:
        'temperature_update': JSON object containing latest temperature.
    """
    try:
        # Read temperature from Modbus register 40001
        raw = client.read_holding_registers(0, 1).registers[0]
        temperature = raw / 10.0  # Convert from tenths of a degree
        emit('temperature_update', {'temp': temperature})
    except Exception:
        emit('error', {'message': 'Sensor read failed'})
````

### **JavaScript Frontend**

```javascript
// Listen for server update and display it in the UI
socket.on('temperature_update', (data) => {
    document.getElementById('temp-display').textContent = `${data.temp} °C`;
});
```

### **HTML Structure**

```html
<!-- Display card for live sensor reading -->
<div class="sensor-widget">
    <h3>Temperature</h3>
    <p id="temp-display">--</p>
</div>
```
