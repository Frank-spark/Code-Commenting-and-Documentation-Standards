## 1. Purpose

This document defines a unified standard for commenting and documenting code used in real-time, sensor-driven, web-based systems that leverage:

- Python (for backend logic and Modbus communications)  
- JavaScript + Socket.IO (for real-time interactivity)  
- HTML/CSS (for frontend rendering and user experience)

Its purpose is to ensure code is clear, maintainable, and scalable.

---

## 2. Why It Matters

Well-documented and clearly commented code:

- Speeds up developer onboarding  
- Reduces maintenance cost and time  
- Prevents misinterpretation of critical logic  
- Ensures product reliability during scale or handoff  
- Enables transparency for internal and external review

---

## 3. Organizational and Business Impact

Poor documentation creates knowledge silos, where only a few engineers can maintain key systems. This introduces serious risks:

- Operational delays when key people are unavailable  
- Increased onboarding costs  
- Slower product cycles  
- Risks during funding rounds or technical due diligence  
- Reduced valuation due to hidden technical debt  

### During Funding and Due Diligence

Investors and acquirers may review the codebase. Lack of documentation can:

- Be flagged as a scalability and continuity risk  
- Delay or reduce funding outcomes  
- Signal immaturity of engineering processes  

### Protecting the Company and Shareholders

- Reduces reliance on individual experts  
- Preserves institutional knowledge  
- Enables continuity during transitions  
- Demonstrates engineering maturity to stakeholders

## 4. General Commenting Guidelines

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Clarity over Cleverness | Write code and comments that are easy to understand |
| Explain “Why”, Not Just “What” | Comments should provide context and rationale |
| Keep Comments Updated | Outdated comments are harmful |
| Avoid Redundancy | Don’t restate obvious logic |
| Use Docstrings | Every public function or method should include a docstring |

---

## 5. Language-Specific Standards

### Python

```python
# Connect to Modbus device
client = ModbusTcpClient('192.168.1.100', port=502)
````

```python
def read_temperature():
    """
    Reads temperature from Modbus register.

    Returns:
        float: Temperature in Celsius.
    Raises:
        ConnectionError: If read fails.
    """
```

```python
# Convert from tenths of a degree Celsius
temperature = raw / 10.0
```

---

### JavaScript

This document assumes usage of vanilla JavaScript. If you're using frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte, component-level documentation should follow framework-specific conventions (e.g., JSDoc, PropTypes, or TypeScript annotations).

```javascript
// Connect to the Socket.IO server
const socket = io();
```

```javascript
// Update the UI with the latest temperature data
socket.on('temperature_update', (data) => {
    document.getElementById('temp-display').textContent = `${data.temp} °C`;
});
```

---

### HTML

```html
<!-- Container for real-time temperature display -->
<div id="dashboard">
    <h2>Live Temperature</h2>
    <p id="temp-display">Waiting for data...</p>
</div>
```

---

### Modbus

```python
# Read register 40001: Temperature in tenths of a degree Celsius
raw = client.read_holding_registers(0, 1).registers[0]
temperature = raw / 10.0
```

---

### Socket.IO

```javascript
// Request sensor data from the server
socket.emit('request_sensor_data');

// Receive and display updated temperature data
socket.on('temperature_update', (data) => {
    updateTemperatureDisplay(data.temp);
});
```

# Smart Monitoring System

## Overview
A real-time monitoring system using Modbus and Socket.IO to display sensor data in a browser-based dashboard.

## Architecture
- Python backend (Modbus + Flask-SocketIO)
- JavaScript frontend (real-time updates)
- HTML/CSS for interface layout

## Business Value
- Real-time monitoring of industrial systems  
- Reduces downtime through faster insight  
- Remote visibility across locations  

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x  
- pymodbus  
- Flask-SocketIO  
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript  

## Setup
pip install -r requirements.txt  
python server.py

## 7. End-to-End Commenting Example

### Python + Socket.IO

```python
@socketio.on('request_sensor_data')
def handle_request():
    """
    Handles frontend request for temperature data.

    Emits:
        'temperature_update': Contains the latest temperature reading.
    """
    try:
        # Read temperature from register 40001
        raw = client.read_holding_registers(0, 1).registers[0]
        temperature = raw / 10.0
        emit('temperature_update', {'temp': temperature})
    except Exception:
        emit('error', {'message': 'Sensor read failed'})
```

### JavaScript Frontend

```javascript
// Receive live temperature update from backend
socket.on('temperature_update', (data) => {
    document.getElementById('temp-display').textContent = `${data.temp} °C`;
});
```

### HTML Structure

```html
<!-- Display block for temperature -->
<div class="sensor-widget">
    <h3>Temperature</h3>
    <p id="temp-display">--</p>
</div>
```

---

## 8. Linting and Style Enforcement

To enforce consistency and reduce formatting issues, the following tools are recommended:

### Python

* `black` – Code formatting
* `flake8` – Style and linting
* `pylint` – Code analysis and metrics
* `pydocstyle` – Docstring formatting

### JavaScript

* `eslint` – Linting JavaScript code
* `prettier` – Auto-formatting

### Markdown / Docs

* `markdownlint` – Linting `.md` files
* Add checks to CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions)
* Use pre-commit hooks to enforce locally

---

## 9. Testing and Documentation

Testing code should also be commented and follow documentation standards.

* Use docstrings in test methods to clarify their intent
* Add comments for setup logic, expected edge cases, and mocks
* Reference bug IDs or business rules when testing regressions

```python
def test_temp_within_bounds():
    """Ensure temperature reading is within safe operating range."""
    ...
```

Documenting tests improves auditability and speeds up triage during production incidents.

---

## 10. Summary

* Clear commenting and documentation improve maintainability
* Reduces dependence on individuals and knowledge silos
* Supports scalability, audits, and investor confidence
* Enforce with tooling (linting, CI, code review)
* Extend standards to tests and frontend components
